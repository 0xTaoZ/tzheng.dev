Linux is still difficult for me sometimes, but it also feels very honest. If something does not work, there is usually a log, a service status, or a command that can explain the problem.

When I learned VPN basics, I started to understand that security is not only encryption as a word. It is also routes, interfaces, DNS, firewall rules, and the trust boundary between networks.

A small thing I like is using commands such as `ip addr`, `ip route`, `systemctl status`, and `journalctl`. They make the machine feel less like a black box.

This kind of learning is slow, but it is useful. I think good security engineers need patience with boring details, because many real problems hide in simple configuration.
